## Join a project
Once you have found something you would like to work on, you can simply make a fork and get going (assuming you found something on GitHub or a similar platform).

Reading the `CONTRIBUTING` file, general `README` and possible the wiki or project's (GitHub) homepage is probably a good place to start.

Make sure to read any guidelines on contributing, the project might require you to work with git in a certain way. If this is the case, you will usualy find any information regarding this matter in `CONTRIBUTING`.

If there is not `CONTRIBUTING` file, consider checking past pull requests.

## Give back
Once you made you change, prepare your pull request as requested by the author(s) (usualy described in the project's `CONTRIBUTING` or `README`).

## Wait and hope for the best
Now you simply wait and see what happens.

### Option 1: Your contribution might not be accepted right away
As the title says, several reasons can lead to your contribution not being accepted (rigtt away). Usualy, the denial comes with an explanation on how your contribution can be made acceptable.

### Option 2: You contribution gets accepted
If you managed to get your contribution into a project: well done and thank you for donating some of your time and effort to the community.

### Option 3: You never hear back
:(
